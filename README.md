Hello! I'm aguywhosaguy. This description was taking from my [website](https://aguywhosaguy.com), albeit with some modifications.

While I haven't really found my place yet, I'm interested in web development. However, frontend isn't really my strong suit, if you couldn't tell by my masterful web design.

My main goal throughout my various coding projects is to make things easier (which is the point of programming), partically in the video gaming space. While not every project I've made pertains to gaming, making mods and programs for games is what got me into programming in the first place.

You can find me on:

- [Github](https://github.com/aguywhosaguy)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@aguywhosaguy)

I also go by the same username on Discord, @aguywhosaguy.

If you wanna see my projects, check out my website linked above.
